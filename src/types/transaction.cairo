///   4. Input that spends an output from a past block

///     * Calculate cache key by hashing (txid, vout, data)
///     * Check if the key is present in the cache
///     * Remove item from the cache

///     * Verify inclusion proof (either individual or batched) against the roots
///     * Delete the leaf from the accumulator

///     * Utreexo proofs can be verified at any point of block validation because accumulator
///       is not changing until the end of the block;
///     * Cache lookups MUST be done in a sequential order, i.e. transactions are validated
///       one by one, first inputs then outputs. Output validation might put something to the
///       cache while input validation might remove an item, thus it's important to maintain
